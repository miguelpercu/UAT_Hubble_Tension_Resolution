
PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF UAT RESULT
=====================================
Optimal rd reduction: 4.1%
Required UAT rd: 141.0 Mpc
UAT H₀: 73.0 km/s/Mpc

CONCLUSION: UAT RESOLVES THE H₀ TENSION
- Maintains H₀ = 73.0 (local value)
- Requires rd = 141.0 Mpc (reduction of 4.1%)
- χ² equivalent to best LCDM fit
- Consistent with early quantum gravity effects

Does UAT resolve the H₀ tension? YES
