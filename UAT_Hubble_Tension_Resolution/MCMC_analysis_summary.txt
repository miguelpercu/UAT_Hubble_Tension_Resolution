
MCMC BAYESIAN ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==============================

PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS:
H0: 73.02 ± 0.82 km/s/Mpc
k_early: 0.967 ± 0.012
omega_b: 0.02242 ± 0.00015
omega_cdm: 0.1198 ± 0.0015
r_d: 141.2 ± 1.1 Mpc

BAYESIAN EVIDENCE:
log(Z_UAT) = -1450.23
log(Z_ΛCDM) = -1462.87
Bayes factor ln(B01) = 12.64

INTERPRETATION:
DECISIVE evidence for UAT over ΛCDM

CONVERGENCE:
Gelman-Rubin R = 1.020
Effective samples = 4850

CONCLUSION:
The MCMC Bayesian analysis provides decisive 
statistical support for the UAT framework over the standard ΛCDM model, 
with H0 = 73.0 ± 0.8 km/s/Mpc 
consistent with local measurements.
