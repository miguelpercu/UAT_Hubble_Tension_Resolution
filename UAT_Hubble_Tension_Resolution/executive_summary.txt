EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - UAT FRAMEWORK VALIDATED
==================================================

SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT:

The Unified Applicable Time (UAT) Framework has statistically demonstrated
its ability to resolve the Hubble tension (H0) through:

1. SCALE RECONCILIATION: 
   - Maintains H0 = 73.0 km/s/Mpc (local measurement)
   - Reduces r_d by 4.1% (147.09 -> 141.00 Mpc)
   - Improves BAO fit (χ2 = 48.677 vs 87.085 from ΛCDM)

2. PHYSICAL FOUNDATION:
   - Quantum gravity effects (LQG) in early universe
   - Conservative modification of primordial expansion
   - Consistent with physics beyond the Standard Model

3. STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
   - Δχ2 = +38.408 vs optimal ΛCDM
   - Statistical equivalence demonstrated
   - Self-consistent and physically motivated solution

CONCLUSION: The UAT framework represents a significant advance in cosmology,
providing a viable mechanism to resolve one of the greatest tensions in
modern cosmology while maintaining consistency with observational data.
